# _CODER_

This is a collection of tools for developing on my Macbook Studio and Macbook Pro - it is a personal project.

## Computer Setup

My Computer has the same username so the ~/code/\_CODER folder will be in the same location on both computers `~/code/_CODER`

## Project Management Scripts

- `/coder_project_template.yaml` - This is a template for creating a new project on my Macbook. It uses the `coder` command to create the project.
- `/projects/create_project.sh` - This is a script that will create a new project on my Macbook. It uses the `coder` command to create the project.
  > TODO: Create the `coder` alias and executable. Consider adding command line CLI with prompts when YAML file is not provided.
- `/projects/dirhelper.py` - This is a script that will helps manage the ~/code/ directory

## System Scripts

-

## .Template Directory

- `/.templates/system/` - This is a collection of template files for my system ranging such as`/.zshrc`, `/.ssh/config`, `/.shared_aliases.template`

- `.templates/system/.zshrc.template` - This is a sample `.zshrc` file that I use on my Macbook, if I make updates, it should be reflected in the `.zshrc.template` file.

<!-- TODO : Need to create a script that will update the `.zshrc.template` file with the latest `.zshrc` file automatically maybe on a cron job. -->
