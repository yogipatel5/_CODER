# System App

This is the system app it handles the system settings and the system configuration like setting up the alfie system cli and the system environment specifically the ZSH shell and the .env file for the system.

This app will also store setting files for apps like iTerm2 and other apps that I use.

This will have a controller script that will update the system to match the environment on my Macbook Studio <> Macbook Pro
