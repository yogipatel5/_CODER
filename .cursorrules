- PYTHONPATH is set to home directory

## When

- Commands should be run from home directory (verify with pwd)
- Operations occur during active development sessions
- Format/lint on save is enabled for Python files (black, ruff, mypy)

## Why

- To ensure proper project configuration
- To facilitate efficient code development and collaboration

## How

# Specfic Instructions

- When working on files for me, and you come across something that might need to be done, but it is not part of the current task, please add a
- [start comment] TODO : Need to xyz [end comment]
- This needs to be in this format because I use the cursor extention to manage my TODOs.

## This Project Information
- We are working on a project called Coder within a Django Framework
- The settings.py file is located at `/Users/yp/Code/_CODER/coder/core/settings.py`
- Alfie, one of the apps is the main entry to the Agent
- Alfie is going to be able to give commands to smaller agents within other apps like Notion.
- Alfie would get a request and with other apps the agent would use other agents to complete the requests.
- For example, if I prompted Alfie to update my project information, he would get the information from the Github agent and then update the Notion agent with the information and get it updated.
- I prefer end to end testing and development, and always prefer to get one thing done and tested especially if its the basis of the other functionality and can serve as a working example.
- The finished project would be a modular project where I can add more apps and agents to the project that Alfie can use.
- Those agents would be given tools in the form of functions so that they can accomplish the tasks. 
- During development, you might find some nice to have features, but if it is not part of the current task or goal, you will add TODO comments to the code. 

**IMPORTANT**
- At the beginning of a chat. If anythime during the chat the project structure is not in your context, you will run 'tree' on the / again. - Once you get to that point, you will stop and reflect what you have accomplished and what you your next steps are and the overarching goal.

- You will run 'tree' on the / to familiarize yourself with the project structure.
- you must ask me what you will be called and what your role is, as it will change on a new chat.
