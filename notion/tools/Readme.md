# Creating your own Tools

Developers can craft custom tools tailored for their agent's needs or utilize pre-built options.

There are two main ways to create a CrewAI tool:

## 1. Subclassing BaseTool

```python
from crewai.tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Name of my tool"
    description: str = "Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Implementation goes here
        return "Result from custom tool"
```

## 2. Utilizing the tool Decorator

```python
from crewai.tools import tool

@tool("Name of my tool")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."""
    # Function logic here
    return "Result from your custom tool"
```

## Structured Tools

The `StructuredTool` class wraps functions as tools, providing flexibility and validation while reducing boilerplate. It supports custom schemas and dynamic logic for seamless integration of complex functionalities.

### Example:
Using `StructuredTool.from_function`, you can wrap a function that interacts with an external API or system, providing a structured interface. This enables robust validation and consistent execution, making it easier to integrate complex functionalities into your applications as demonstrated in the following example:

```python
from crewai.tools.structured_tool import CrewStructuredTool
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define the schema for the tool's input using Pydantic
class APICallInput(BaseModel):
    endpoint: str
    parameters: dict

# Wrapper function to execute the API call
def tool_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    # Here, you would typically call the API using the parameters
    # For demonstration, we'll return a placeholder string
    return f"Call the API at {kwargs['endpoint']} with parameters {kwargs['parameters']}"

# Create and return the structured tool
def create_structured_tool():
    return CrewStructuredTool.from_function(
        name='Wrapper API',
        description="A tool to wrap API calls with structured input.",
        args_schema=APICallInput,
        func=tool_wrapper,
    )

# Example usage
structured_tool = create_structured_tool()

# Execute the tool with structured input
result = structured_tool._run(**{
    "endpoint": "https://example.com/api",
    "parameters": {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
})
print(result)  # Output: Call the API at https://example.com/api with parameters {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
```

## Custom Caching Mechanism

Tools can optionally implement a `cache_function` to fine-tune caching behavior. This function determines when to cache results based on specific conditions, offering granular control over caching logic.

```python
from crewai.tools import tool

@tool
def multiplication_tool(first_number: int, second_number: int) -> str:
    """Useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together."""
    return first_number * second_number

def cache_func(args, result):
    # In this case, we only cache the result if it's a multiple of 2
    cache = result % 2 == 0
    return cache

multiplication_tool.cache_function = cache_func

writer1 = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="You write lessons of math for kids.",
    backstory="You're an expert in writing and you love to teach kids but you know nothing of math.",
    tools=[multiplication_tool],
    allow_delegation=False,
)
```

## Conclusion

Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively. When building solutions with CrewAI, leverage both custom and existing tools to empower your agents and enhance the AI ecosystem. Consider utilizing error handling, caching mechanisms, and the flexibility of tool arguments to optimize your agents' performance and capabilities.
