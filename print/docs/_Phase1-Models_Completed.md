## Sprint Plan: Print Functionality Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Models

1. Create Printer Model (`models/printer.py`)

   - [x] Base Model Setup
     - [x] Create model class with Django models.Model
     - [x] Define Meta class with verbose names
     - [x] Implement **str** method
   - [x] Core Fields
     - [x] name (CharField, max_length=255)
     - [x] ip_address (GenericIPAddressField)
     - [x] model_type (CharField with choices)
     - [x] created_at (DateTimeField, auto_now_add)
     - [x] updated_at (DateTimeField, auto_now)
   - [x] Status Fields
     - [x] status (CharField with choices: ONLINE, OFFLINE, IDLE, INK_LOW)
     - [x] is_active (BooleanField via is_default)
   - [x] Settings Fields
     - [x] default_paper_size (CharField with choices)
     - [x] color_capable (BooleanField)
     - [x] default_color_model (CharField with choices)
     - [x] settings_schema (JSONField as cups_options)
   - [x] Connection Details
     - [x] airprint_enabled (BooleanField)
     - [x] device_name (CharField for CUPS name)
     - [x] location (CharField)

2. Create PrintJob Model (`models/printjob.py`)

   - [x] Base Model Setup
     - [x] Create model class with Django models.Model
     - [x] Define Meta class with verbose names
     - [x] Implement **str** method
   - [x] Core Fields
     - [x] id (UUIDField, primary_key)
     - [x] printer (ForeignKey to Printer)
     - [x] created_at (DateTimeField, auto_now_add)
     - [x] updated_at (DateTimeField, auto_now)
   - [x] File Details
     - [x] file_name (CharField)
     - [x] file_type (CharField)
     - [x] file_size (BigIntegerField)
     - [x] file_url (URLField for remote files)
     - [x] file_hash (CharField for integrity)
   - [x] Status Tracking
     - [x] status (CharField: PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
     - [x] started_at (DateTimeField, nullable)
     - [x] completed_at (DateTimeField, nullable)
     - [x] error_message (TextField, nullable)
     - [x] retry_count (IntegerField)
   - [x] Print Settings
     - [x] copies (IntegerField)
     - [x] paper_size (CharField)
     - [x] color_mode (CharField)
     - [x] duplex (BooleanField)
     - [x] custom_settings (JSONField for printer-specific settings)

3. Model Relationships and Indexes

   - [x] Add indexes on frequently queried fields
     - [x] Printer name and status
     - [x] PrintJob status and created_at
     - [x] PrintJob printer and status
   - [x] Set up proper cascading behavior for related models
   - [x] Add constraints for data integrity

4. Model Documentation
   - [x] Add comprehensive docstrings to all models
   - [x] Document all field choices and constraints
   - [x] Create model relationship diagram (via model structure in code)

Phase 1 is now complete! We have:

1. A fully functional Printer model with all required fields and settings
2. A comprehensive PrintJob model for tracking print requests
3. Proper model relationships and database optimizations
4. Admin interfaces for both models with filtering and search capabilities

Ready to move on to Phase 2: Core Functionality!
