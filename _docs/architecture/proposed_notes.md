Development & Contributor Experience
Local Environment Setup

Consider detailing the exact steps a new contributor would take to get the system up and running on their machine. You currently mention Conda, but you might expand on:
How to configure Conda environments (e.g., environment.yml or requirements.txt).
Any OS-specific quirks or recommended versions of Python, Node, etc.
Any project-level environment variables or .env files needed.
Common Developer Tasks

Provide a "day in the life" of a developer: how they run tests, lint/format code, add new commands, or integrate with external services (e.g., Cloudflare, Proxmox, or Vault).
Clarify your standards for commits (e.g., conventional commits), pull requests, and code reviews.
Detailed Example Workflows

Show a few real "end-to-end" flows. For instance, how to create and deploy a new Django project with Alfie, set up DNS in Cloudflare, and configure NGINX Proxy Manager in a single cohesive example.
Django Command vs. Alfie CLI

You do a great job showing how Django commands map to Alfie commands; it might be helpful to show how to extend an existing command or add a new command from scratch. This ensures new developers can confidently add new features.
2. Architecture & Project Structure
App-By-App Explanation

You provide a good overview of each app's responsibilities. You could add:
Diagrams or flowcharts illustrating how data flows between apps (e.g., from network/ to projects/ or from system/ to external services).
Brief explanations of how each app interacts with Vault, GitHub, or other integrated APIs.
Async vs. Sync

In the code snippets, you use async in some places. Clarify which parts of the system are async, how concurrency is handled, and whether developers need special async patterns (e.g., asyncio loops, channels, or Celery tasks).
Cross-App Communication

Where do events get passed from one app to another (e.g., from projects/ to network/)? Provide an example of how one app might call services in another. This helps developers see the bigger picture.
Configuration Management

You mention environment-specific Vault configurations, but you might expand on:
How secrets and config are separated across staging/production.
How to add new secrets for an app.
How environment variables and Vault interplay in local development vs. production.
3. Security & Networking
Network Diagram & Firewall Rules

Adding a simple diagram of how PFSense, Cloudflare, and Proxmox are interconnected helps developers and ops teams quickly understand traffic flow and firewall boundaries.
Outline typical firewall rules or segments. (For instance, which VLANs are used for dev, staging, production, etc.?)
Vault Access Patterns

Show how an application or a developer account fetches secrets from Vault.
Provide details on the roles/permissions structure: how to request a new role, rotate tokens, or set up policy enforcement.
Zero Trust / ACL Strategies

If you're using advanced patterns (like short-lived tokens, user certificates, or IP whitelisting), detail them.
This is especially important for new developers who need to know how to request access or ensure they are conforming to your security best practices.
4. Monitoring & Observability
Dashboards & Alerts

Since you have Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry, highlight which dashboards exist or how a developer can create a new one.
Explain how alerts are configured in Prometheus and integrated in Grafana, and how devs can add custom metrics/alerts for their new services.
Log Aggregation

If you're using any centralized logging (ELK/EFK stack or something else), document that flow.
Provide guidance on what logging library or format (JSON logs, structured logs, etc.) you expect in Django and other Python components.
5. Testing & QA
Test Strategy

Break out the difference between unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
Provide a sample test for a typical manager or service to help new developers quickly grasp your testing approach.
CI/CD Pipeline

Detail how merges trigger builds or deployments.
Document how environment-specific tests or checks run (e.g., lint checks, security scans, integration with GitHub Actions or other CI services).
If there's a staging environment, clarify how changes are promoted from dev to staging to production.
Security & Compliance Testing

If you have security scans or vulnerability tests, mention them.
This is crucial for developers who need to ensure their code meets your security standards before merging.
6. Future Roadmap & Contributions
How to Propose and Add New Features

Provide a template for new feature proposals. This might include how to request changes to Alfie or new integrations with other cloud services.
Outline the design review process, code review guidelines, and acceptance criteria.
Refactoring & Deprecation

If you have a policy for sunsetting older apps or commands, let developers know so they can plan accordingly and avoid building on top of legacy components.
Scaling Beyond Proxmox

You mention Proxmox, which is your go-to virtualization environment. Should developers consider any future expansions or load balancing? If so, how?
Clarifying the approach to scaling helps devs design solutions that align with your infrastructure strategy.
Summary
Overall, your documentation does an excellent job covering the "what" of this project—what components exist, what they do, and how they fit together. The biggest wins you can get right now are around detailing the "how" for everyday tasks:

How a developer sets up the environment from scratch.
How a developer extends Alfie or a Django command to handle new functionality.
How the security frameworks and networking layers fit together end to end.
How to approach testing, monitoring, and logging in a practical, day-to-day sense.
Adding these more concrete, example-driven guidelines will make the project more approachable for newcomers and more maintainable for the entire team.

Feel free to ask if you'd like additional detail or a specific deep dive on any aspect of the documentation.
