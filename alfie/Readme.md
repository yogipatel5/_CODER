# Alfie

This is the cli tool that will be used to manage the infrastructure.

## Installation

- Will have to use a script to install it in the .zshrc file

Alfie will be able to set-up whole project scripts including production and development servers using the apps within network and projects.

Alfie will be used by LLM to tool call and manage the infrastucture as well as manage sprints and tasks. Alfie will be a coding assistant for the project and will be able to install dependencies, run scripts, and manage the project.

The best part of this system is that there will be a LLM that will receive commands in natural language and will be able to execute them, as well as fix invalid cli prompts and correct them.

If errors happen, Alfie will return a message to summarize the error and offer possible solutions which can be used to fix the error.

## Models

- Since the project is using LLM, we will need to use a model that is able to handle natural language and execute commands.
- We will also need a way to store sprints so that will give Alfie context when working with other LLM agents to manage the project.
