# Sprint 1: Project Creation Automation

**Sprint Goal:** Implement the core functionality for creating new projects based on YAML configurations.

**Sprint Duration:** 1 week (This is an estimate, as I am an LLM, I can work continuously)

**Developer:** AI Assistant (LLM)

**Sprint Backlog:**

**Story Points:**

* 1 point = 1 hour of work
* 2 points = 2-3 hours of work
* 3 points = 4-6 hours of work

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Task 1: YAML Parsing and Configuration Loading**
  * The script should accept a YAML file path as a command-line argument.
  * The script should be able to parse the YAML file and load the configurations into a data structure (e.g., a Python dictionary).
  * The script should handle cases where the YAML file is missing or invalid.
* **Task 2: Project Directory Creation**
  * The script should create the specified directories and files in the project directory.
  * The script should handle cases where the directory already exists.
  * The script should create the project directory at the path specified in the YAML file.
* **Task 3: Template File Copying**
  * The script should copy the specified template files to the project directory.
  * The script should handle cases where the template file is missing.
  * The script should handle cases where the destination file already exists.
* **Task 4: Conda Environment Creation**
  * The script should create a conda environment with the specified Python version and environment name.
  * The script should handle cases where the conda environment already exists.
  * The script should install the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file if it exists.
* **Task 5: Git Repository Initialization and Initial Commit**
  * The script should initialize a git repository in the project directory.
  * The script should create the specified branches.
  * The script should make an initial commit with the specified commit message.
* **Task 6: Error Handling and Logging**
  * The script should handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
  * The script should log all actions and errors to a log file.
* **Task 7: Address Missing Template File**
  * The script should either add the missing template file (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) to the templates directory or remove it from the configuration.
* **Task 8: Implement `copy_all` Functionality**
  * The script should implement the `copy_all` functionality to copy all files from the templates directory.

**Definition of Done:**

* All tasks in the sprint backlog are completed.
* All acceptance criteria are met.
* The code is well-documented and follows coding standards.
* The code is tested and free of bugs.

**Notes:**

* This sprint focuses on the core functionality of project creation.
* More advanced features can be added in future sprints.
* I will provide regular updates on my progress.
* The missing template file and `copy_all` functionality should be addressed before considering the sprint complete.
